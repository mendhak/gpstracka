                <dt>Verbose</dt>
                <dd>Sometimes, the GPS logging may not work (inside a building, train, new country, alien invasion, etc). If you click verbose, the textbox will start displaying the raw GPS NMEA data being received by the receiver. If you understand it, then good for you, else it&#39;s something cool and complicated to show to your uninterested friends. But the main parameters you&#39;re looking for are GPGGA (location) and GPGSV (satellites visible). If you want to understand it, you can read up on <a href="http://home.mira.net/~gnb/gps/nmea.html">NMEA sentence information</a>. I also recommend you use this the very first time you run the application to figure out which COM port and Baud Rate is right for you.</dd>
                <dd>Note: Verbose log is not available when using Windows Intermediate GPS driver.</dd>
                <dt>Clear</dt>
                <dd>This clears the textbox.</dd>
                <dt>Settings</dt>
                <dd>This takes you to the <a href="#Config">settings screen</a> where you can specify the COM port, baud rate, and where to log the GPS data.</dd>
                <dt>Exit</dt>
                <dd>Quits the application. If you click this while GPS is active, you will be asked to quit. When logging to file, your data are never lost by terminating the aplication - correctly, or because of device shutdown or application crash.</dd>
                <dt>Sattelites</dt>
                <dd>
                    Shows GPS sattelites information - signal strength, satellite visibility and location on sky. Sattelite infromation are actualized only when GPS&nbsp;device is actually running.</dd>
                <dt>Start</dt>
                <dd>Obviously, this starts the logging. If you selected Verbose in the options menu, it&#39;ll give you all data being received in the textbox. Else, it will log the data at the specified interval to the textbox or file.</dd>
                <dd>If you have logged some data recently and you stopped logging and then you press start, you are asked to continue logging to the same file. This does not occure when you restart the application or visit the settings screen (a new file is created).</dd>
                <dt>Stop</dt>
                <dd>The Start button changes to Stop when you press Start. Then you can use it to stop GPS logging.</dd>

                        <dd>This drop down is the COM port that gives you your GPS data. This may be different on different phones. For me, it was COM1. You&#39;ll need to determine this for yourself by setting it and using Verbose mode.</dd>
                        <dd>If you are using another port, not listed in the drop down, then you can type it in anyways. Note: SOmetimes port may be named GPC instead of COM.</dd>
                        <dd>In case you have device with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb202086.aspx">Microsft GPS Intermediate Driver</a> (probably yes; its supported in Windows Embedded CE 6.0 and later and Windows Mobile 5.0 and later), the driver output port (as set up in registry) is displayed right of combo box as recomended. You should use it as it allows multiple GPS applications to wor in the same time. You can for example when riding a car, you can use a GPS navigation software (like iGO) for navigation and GPSTracka for logging.</dd>
                        <dt>Baud Rate</dt>
                        <dd>The data transfer speed. Different GPS receivers use different speeds, so you will need to experiment. I use 4800.</dd>

                <dt>Polling Rate</dt>
                <dd>How often the GPS data should be logged to textbox or file. I usually set this at 300 seconds.</dd>
                <dd>Shorter polling interval causes more precise log. On the other hand shorter polling interval means bigger power consumption. Seting depends on speed you are going to move. For same precision you must set shorter interval when driving a car than while walking.</dd>
                <dt>Logging Options - To Text Box</dt>
                <dd>The best way to know that it&#39;s working is to keep this box checked, so that you can see the values printed to the textbox. When not checked you have no control if GPS is working or not.</dd>
                <dt>Logging Options - To File</dt>
                <dd>To log to file, tick this checkbox and then select a folder by clicking the &quot;...&quot; button. It&#39;s best if you create a &quot;GPSLogs&quot; folder in &quot;My Documents&quot; or on your Storage Card and then specify that path.</dd>
                <dd>If not checked, you wil not have GPS log for future use! GPS logs are stored in files named by date and time when logging started.</dd>
                <dt>Format GPX/KML/CSV</dt>
                <dd>Some people prefer GPX (GPS XML format), some prefer KML (Google Earth XML format). If you want a lightweight file, then go for GPX; if you want to use your file with Google Earth, use KML (Google Earth can load GPX as well).</dd>
                <dd>CSV format is simple text format where date, latitude, longitude and altitude are loged comma separated. It can be in detail configured in Advanced configuration.</dd>
                <dt>Log altitude</dt>
                <dd>Check this to log altitude informations as well. When not checked track / points are rendered on the ground.</dd>
                <dd>
                    Note: GPS altitude is somewhat different from altitude you can see in maps or Google Earth. This may cause the track to be rendered in mid-air or underground. You can easily instruct Google Earth to ignore track elevation (in case of points it&#39;s not as easy because you must change the setting for each point separatelly). The difference between GPS altitude and true altitude is caused by the way how it is measured by GPS and traditionally. GPS uses some unified ellipsoid (WGS84) model, while traditional measurement uses some local sea level whih can vary by the sea actually used. This difference is usually constant in one map and certain area and good map usually contains the informatin how its altitude differs from GPS altitude - you can then set altitude correction in advanced settings. Also keep in mind that GPS altitude is approximatelly 1.5 time accurate than longitude/latitude. In case your receiver supports it and you are using Windows GPS driver, you can instruct it in advanced 
                    settings to obtain true sea-level evelation instead of ellipsoid elevation.</dd>
                <dt>Distinct points / track</dt>
                <dd>The distinc points option logs just separate points to KML/GPX file, while Track logs connection line between them as well. Ignored for CSV.</dd>
                <dd>Note: Points are always logged to KML, because KML does not allow description for track points. You can easily turn points on and off in Google Earth or even delete them as they are in single folder.</dd>

                    <dd>There are two possible sources of time informations, the GPS time provided by satellites and time provided by your device (set in control panel). GPS time is always acurate. GPS reports universal time (UTC), but the application can convert it for you to local time according to time zone set in Windows control panel.</dd>
                    <dt>Altitude correction</dt>
                    <dd>GPS altitude usually differes from altitude you can see in maps or Google Earth. This is caused by different style of measurement - GPS&nbsp;uses WGS84 ellipsoid. The difference is usualy constant for one map in certain area and good map gives you he information about the difference, so you can set-up correction here. Bad or no correction may cause your tracks and points to be rendered in mid-air or underground. You can turn altitude logging off as well (in settings screen). For yachting it is really not important.</dd>
                    <dt>Start immediatelly</dt>
                    <dd>By default GPSTRacka first waits for poling interval time before it records first point. Checking this forces the application to log first point immediatelly when you click Start.</dd>
                    <dt>Minimal distance</dt>
                    <dd>You may observe quite accurate GPS log while you are moving. But once you stop, you may see many points placed randomly around your actual location. You may prevent GPSTracka from logging points that are near from last logged location. This prevents multiple logs at/near same place, when you stop for a while. This sets up minimal distance between two points being logged. You should experiment a little with this. The right number depends on behavior of your GPS receiver, how fast you are moving and which precision of track log you want. 5 to 10 meters can be good option.</dd>

                    <dd>
                        Because keeping GPS device running consumes some batery power, it&#39;s usefull to stop it when it does not provide any meaningful data (like when you are in a tunnel). On the other hand setting this to low number may cause that GPS device will never start reading data after leaving a tunnel, because the application will simply close it before it can find sattelites.

                    Formatting is a little tricky process used by programmers in .NET to display date, time, numeric and other values in different formats. Specificly string formatting replaces each occurence of {x} with string representation corresponding object. x is decimal number - 0-based index of object. More, {x} can be in format {x,len}, {x:format} or {x,len:format}.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>x</dt>
                    <dd>0-based index of object passed py application to formatting. Actual value depends on application.</dd>
                    <dt>len</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Number - minimal lenght of string representation of the object. If actual string representation of the object is shorter than len it is paded with spaces to given length. If positive, the parameter is right-aligned; if negative, it is left-aligned.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>format</dt>
                    <dd>This is the most important and most tricky parameter. It defines how the value is formatted. If omited default formatting (depends on object type and value and control panel settings) is used.</dd>
                    <dd>Actual valid value of format depends on type of object being passed to formatting.</dd>
                    <dd>Basically there are two types of formatting - predefined (single letter) and custom. For complete guide see <a href="http://dzonny.cz/Portals/0/DOCs/Formatting.pdf">.NET formatting guide</a>.</dd>
